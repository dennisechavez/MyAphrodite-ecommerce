  <p>The world seems to be getting worse in many ways right now: we are in the middle of a pandemic, thousands of people have lost their jobs, teenagers
    and young adults struggle when trying to find a reason to continue believing in having a "great future" ahead of them. New cynics are being created,
  conforming with the dark turn things have taken.</p>
  <p>But there is still hope. At least we like to believe so. We have to remember to take a step back and see things for what they truly are: a miracle.
    Look around and realize that every breath you take can be a new beginning, for every creature in this planet.</p>
